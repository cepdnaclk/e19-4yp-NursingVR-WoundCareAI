## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an AI-driven VR training system for advanced wound care nursing education, developed as part of research at the University of Peradeniya's Department of Computer Engineering.

**Key Features:**
- 🩺 5-phase VR wound care simulation (Scenario → History → Assessment → Cleaning → Evaluation)
- 🗣️ Conversational AI with fine-tuned LLMs for patient interaction and evaluation
- 🎮 Unity-based VR environment with haptic feedback integration
- 🎙️ Voice interaction using STT/TTS pipelines
- 📊 Automated performance assessment and feedback system
