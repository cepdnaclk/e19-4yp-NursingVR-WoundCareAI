## Development Guidelines
1. 
   - Never commit library folders (add to `.gitignore`)
   - Document required libraries in `dependencies.txt`
   - Keep test assets in appropriate `/experiments/` subfolders

## Important Notes
⚠️ This is an experimental branch - code may be unstable and behind the Main
⚠️ Don't merge this to main
